# Contact reminders for power connectors

This repo contains an Excel workbook to accomplish the core bookkeeping in [How
to be a Power Connector](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780071830737) by Judy
Robinett.

At the time of writing, I can prove that I've talked to all 177 people in my
"tribe" in the last 16 weeks. I've been able to prove such a thing continuously
for 1.5 years. If this level of care for relationships inspires you, it's in
your power to get there, too, with the help of this workbook.

In the pre-industrial age, with your tribe all in close physical proximity,
memory and random encounters were enough to stay current with your tribe. In
the industrial age, with relationships spanning great distance and pandemics
limiting proximity, these tools are inadequate. Human cognition is simply bad
at noticing who isn't there. Memory alone allows far too many people at the
periphery of your tribe to fade into disconnection, causing your world to
implode into social isolation. If you rely on social media, you're pulled into
too many connections of too low a quality, sorted badly. Social media gives the
most headspace to the smuggest, neediest, or most controversial acquaintances
(who sell engagement and ads) instead of the most generous or reliable.

Robinett argues that the heart of "networking" or "strategic relationship
management" is the following workflow:

- Identify your tribe: all significant interpersonal relationships encompassing
  family, friendship, work, community, etc. Its size will roughly be [Dunbar's
  number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) (100-250, nominally
  ~150).
- Divide this tribe into a few "power circles" or frequency tiers (Robinett
  suggests three tiers: 5 + 50 + 100 = 155).
- Commit to a frequency of contact for each power circle (Robinett suggests
  being in touch with each of the 5 daily, each of the 50 weekly, and each of
  the 100 monthly) and reach out to add value to these people at least this
  often.
- Continually upgrade these power circles as you meet worthwhile new people and
  others inevitably roll off.

This workbook (built with Excel for Mac 2019 but backward-compatible to Excel
2003) provides a place to maintain a list of people, their place in one's power
circles, and information about the most recent contact for each of them. It
uses some conditional formatting and custom sorting to make it comfortable to
carry out Robinett's proposal in practice, getting reliable contact reminders
at a glance when "it has been too long" with someone important instead of
relying on a fallible memory to do so.

Robinett's recommendations add up to a baseline of adding value to ~15
different people in one's power circles every day, 365 days a year. I don't
consider this realistic for people with an occupation other than "full-time
networker." This spreadsheet's defaults for the sizes and frequencies of the
tiers dial these parameters down a great deal while staying true to Robinett's
basic Dunbar's-number-based structure:

- The default power circle sizes are 5 + 25 + 120 = 150.
- The spreadsheet suggests being in touch with each of the 5 weekly, each of
  the 25 every 4 weeks, and each of the 120 every 16 weeks. This adds up to a
  handful of people every day. (5/7 + 25/28 + 120/112 = 2.68, but the number of
  people you communicate with on an average day will be higher. You will often
  connect with people spontaneously before they've fallen to 0% recency in the
  spreadsheet, and asynchronous conversations like email threads often span
  many days.)

I've found this reduced intensity to be sustainable in lieu of being routinely
on social media: it consumes similar time and emotional energy but with far
richer rewards. The frequency of contact enforced by this system keeps
friendships warm even in isolating life circumstances, such as in COVID times
as a serial transplant with many young parents for friends.  It also helps
independents like me keep a professional network healthy even when busy (e.g.,
when deep in a client project).

## Initial setup

1. In place of the fake data in the `power_circles` sheet, under the columns
   `first_name`, `last_name`, `last_contacted`, and `description`, assemble a
   list of all the people you've been in touch with in the recent past and when
   and how you were in contact with them. I wrote some little scripts
   (unpublished) to merge names from social media data exports, cell phone
   contacts, etc., but regardless of automation, this is a lot of clerical
   effort given how many ways (including analog in-person conversations) you
   likely connect with people. I ended up with 1300-1400 distinct people; the
   latter two fields were unknown for most of them.
1. Start everyone at a `tier` of 0.
1. Make a pass through everyone. When you see a relationship that feels warm
   (or that deserves effort to get to warm), assign them an appropriate tier
   (1, 2, or 3; 3 is the warmest) depending on how close they are. This large
   number of emotional judgment calls is also a lot of effort.
1. Use Excel's "custom sort" to sort people by tier, then by last contacted,
   then by last name. This custom sort has been saved in this spreadsheet. You
   can pull it up using `Alt + A + S + S` on Excel 365 (`Cmd-Shift-R` on my
   2019 Excel for Mac). You'll use this custom sort all of the time in this
   spreadsheet.
1. Massage these tier labels until their sizes are reasonably in line with the
   above guidance. They don't have to be exact (at the time of writing my power
   circles are 2 + 16 + 159 = 177).
1. Set up the maximum days between contacts you'd like to commit to for these
   tiers, and enter them in the `tiers` sheet.
1. You'll probably find that you're in the red at first with a lot of the
   people in your tier 1. Perform outreach at a sustainable pace, 1-2 people
   per day, until the red is gone.

## Maintenance of your power circles

1. Every day, enter the date and description of your interactions with everyone
   in your power circles. The `Ctrl-;` shortcut key for today's date is key
   here.
1. Re-apply the custom sort shortcut key to tidy up the list and easily review
   who is "bubbling up" in your power circles.
1. Typically, socially intense events (weddings, deaths, reunions) will refresh
   a lot of connections at the periphery of your tribe. A clump of these tier 1
   people will then bubble up 16 weeks later. To mitigate the stress of this,
   it's helpful to routinely be steady in reaching out to 1-2 people who have
   bubbled up each day, building up a margin so you can gradually work through
   clumps that bubble up.
1. Use the `average_recency` sheet to monitor things. The aforementioned clumps
   organize themselves, bubble upward, and smooth out over multiple 16-week
   cycles. You may occasionally get slammed with other obligations and spend
   less time on relationships. The average recency provides a crude measurement
   of all this.  My average recency fluctuates in the 57-68% range; steady is
   good.
1. Add, remove, promote, and demote people from your power circles as they
   become relevant, ghost you, etc., by adding rows or adjusting tier labels.
