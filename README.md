# some_crm

*Currently just an idea*

A customer-relationship database and app for a small professional-services
business.

Motivations to re-invent the wheel on such a prosaic back-office function:

- I already have enough legacy sales data in Excel that porting it "nicely" to
  a commercial CRM, whose data model I must infer through their interface,
  might be tedious on its own.
- I want flexible analytic access to my own sales funnel to monitor sales and
  marketing efforts, understand what kinds of prospects are working for me, and
  estimate the demand curve for my services.
- Small-time independent data collegues might like an open-source,
  open-data-format CRM that they can understand and hack on. This might foster
  some professional relationships.
- I could use a "portfolio piece" and blog post on relational data modeling.
  Modeling reality as tables through the entity-relationship model is the
  foundational task of data craftsmanship, but it's chronically ignored.
  Usually, data models are hasty, ad hoc, and wrong, stood up without much
  thought by an organization in startup mode. Careful data craftsmen are
  usually hired after the symptoms of a wrong data model become intolerable.
  Remedying a wrong data model after it has been coupled to operations tends to
  be expensive and constrained by existing usage. Raising the profile of data
  modeling among a few people might make the world a touch better.
